## NEXARDA™ - Game more, for less!
Welcome to the API Documentation for NEXARDA™ - the video game price comparison website built for gamers. Here you can view available API endpoints for our website to implement our service in your project/website. All API endpoints are currently 100% free to use and don't require authentication. We monitor all incoming requests and block any abusive/harmful IPs. We work closely with our approved online retailers and fetch product prices of video games, game consoles and gaming gear in different currencies, then present the best deals to users in multiple regions. They can then decide which offer they want and purchase the game through the store's website - where we may earn a commission as an affiliate at no extra cost to the buyer.
