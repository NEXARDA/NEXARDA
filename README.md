## NEXARDA™ - Game more, for less!
Welcome to the Official API Documentation for NEXARDA™, here you explore different endpoints and examples to show you how to use them. Our API endpoints are currently 100% free rate-limit free, but we will block any IP's that we think are harmful or abusive to our servers. You do not need a NEXARDA™ account or any type of authorization to use the API endpoints. You can also use our HTML Embeds via JavaScript (coming soon) and make requests to our API's via CORS.

As a price comparison website for video games, we work directly with retailers to fetch prices in different currencies to show our customers the best (cheapest) possible prices in their region. We make money through affiliate programs with these retailers when users make purchases. Unfortunately, we don't currently offer any type of partnership/loyalty programs or sub-affiliate programs for users to earn money with us.

With our API endpoints you can do a number of things:
- Display and log video game prices/discounts on your website.
- Search for video games, franchises, studios, consoles and gear (on all platforms).
- Embed games, studios, consoles and gear on your website.

Please stay tuned whilst we work on this documentation and API endpoints for public use, we will announce our API's in the coming months if things go to plan. Stay safe and make sure to star this project on GitHub!
