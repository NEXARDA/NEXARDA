## NEXARDA™ - Game more, for less!
Welcome to the <a href="https://github.com/NEXARDA/NEXARDA/wiki">API Documentation</a> for NEXARDA™ - the video game price comparison website built for gamers. Here you can view the available API endpoints for our platform to implement our service in your project, app or website. Most endpoints are free to use and don't require authentication (apart from some endpoints - these require API keys to be issued). Please note that we monitor all incoming API requests and will block any requests, bot traffic and/or IPs that we deem abusive/harmful.

We work closely with our approved online retailers and fetch product prices of video games, game consoles and gaming gear in different currencies, then present the best deals to users in multiple regions. They can then decide which offer they want and purchase the game through the store's website - where we may earn a commission as an affiliate at no extra cost to the buyer.
